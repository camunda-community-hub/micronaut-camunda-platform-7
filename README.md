# micronaut-camunda-bpm

This open source project allows you to easily integrate [Camunda](https://camunda.com/products/bpmn-engine/) into [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) projects.

Micronaut is known for its efficient use of resources. With this integration you embed the BPMN 2.0 compliant and developer friendly Camunda process engine with minimal memory footprint into your application.

The integration is preconfigured with sensible defaults, so that you can get started with minimal configuration: simply add a dependency in your Micronaut project!

# ✨Features
* Camunda can be integrated as an embedded process engine into a Micronaut project by simply [adding a dependency](#dependency-management) in build.gradle (Gradle) or pom.xml (Maven).
* Using H2 as an in-memory database is as simple as [adding a dependency](#dependency-management). Other [data sources can be configured](#data-source) via properties.
* BPMN process models and DMN decision tables are [automatically deployed](#deploying-models) for all configured locations.
* The Camunda process engine with its job executor is started automatically - but the job executor is disabled for tests by default.
* The process engine and related services, e.g. RuntimeService, RepositoryService, ..., are provided as lazy initialized beans and [can be injected](#camunda-integration).
* Micronaut beans are resolved from the application context if they are [referenced by expressions or Java class names](#java-delegates) within the process models.
* The process engine [integrates with Micronaut's transaction manager](#transaction-management). Optionally, micronaut-data-jdbc or micronaut-data-jpa are supported.
* Eventing Bridge that maps Camunda Events to Micronaut ApplicationEvents.
* The process engine can be configured with [generic properties](#generic-properties).
* The [Camunda REST API and the Webapps](#camunda-rest-api-and-webapps) are supported (currently only for Jetty).
* The [Camunda Enterprise Edition (EE)](#camunda-enterprise-edition-ee) is supported. 
* [Process Engine Plugins](#process-engine-plugins) are automatically activated on start.
* The job executor uses the Micronaut IO Executor's [thread pools](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#threadPools).
* The [process engine configuration](#custom-process-engine-configuration) and the [job executor configuration](#custom-job-executor-configuration) can be customized programmatically.
* A Camunda admin user is created if configured by [properties](#properties) and not present yet (including admin group and authorizations).
* Camunda's telemetry feature is automatically deactivated during test execution.

# 🚀Getting Started

This section describes what needs to be done to use `micronaut-camunda-bpm-feature` in a Micronaut project.

Here are some example applications:
* [Onboarding Process](https://github.com/tobiasschaefer/micronaut-camunda-example-onboarding) with service tasks, user tasks, and message correlation.
* Simple [application with Java/Maven](https://github.com/tobiasschaefer/micronaut-camunda-example-java-maven)
* Simple [application with Kotlin/Gradle](https://github.com/tobiasschaefer/micronaut-camunda-example-kotlin-gradle)
* [Internal example application](/micronaut-camunda-bpm-example) used during development

## Supported JDKs

We officially support the following JDKs:
* JDK 8 (LTS)
* JDK 11 (LTS)
* JDK 17 (LTS)

## Dependency Management

The Camunda integration works with both Gradle and Maven, but we recommend using Gradle because it has better Micronaut Support.

You have the following options to integrate the Camunda integration:
* Create a new Micronaut project using [Micronaut Launch](https://micronaut.io/launch?name=micronaut-camunda&features=camunda) and check that the "camunda" feature is selected. If you don't select any database then an in-memory H2 will be included by default.
* Manually add the dependency to an existing Micronaut project:
  <details>
  <summary>Click to show Gradle configuration</summary>

  Add the dependency to the build.gradle file:
  ```groovy
  implementation("info.novatec:micronaut-camunda-bpm-feature:2.1.0")
  runtimeOnly("com.h2database:h2")
  ```
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Click to show Maven configuration</summary>

  Add the dependency to the pom.xml file:
  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>info.novatec</groupId>
    <artifactId>micronaut-camunda-bpm-feature</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
  </dependency>
  ```
  </details>

Note: The module `micronaut-camunda-bpm-feature` includes the dependency `org.camunda.bpm:camunda-engine` which will be resolved transitively.

##  Deploying Models
BPMN process models (`*.bpmn`) and DMN decision tables (`*.dmn`) should be created with the [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/products/camunda-bpm/modeler) and saved in the resources.

By default only the root of the resources will be scanned, but with the [property](#properties) `camunda.locations` you can configure the locations.

When starting the application you'll see the log output: `Deploying model: classpath:xxxxxxx.bpmn`

## Camunda Integration

### Process Engine and Services

Inject the process engine or any of the Camunda services using constructor injection:
```java
import jakarta.inject.Singleton;
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.ProcessEngine;
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.RuntimeService;

@Singleton
public class MyComponent {

    private final ProcessEngine processEngine;
    private final RuntimeService runtimeService;
    
    public MyComponent(ProcessEngine processEngine, RuntimeService runtimeService) {
        this.processEngine = processEngine;
        this.runtimeService = runtimeService;
    }

    // ...
}
```

Alternatively to constructor injection, you can also use field injection, Java bean property injection, or method parameter injection.

You can then for example use the `runtimeService` to start new processes instances or correlate existing process instances.

### Java Delegates

To invoke a Java delegate create a bean and reference it in your process model using an expression, e.g. `${loggerDelegate}`:

```java
import jakarta.inject.Singleton;
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.delegate.DelegateExecution;
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.delegate.JavaDelegate;

@Singleton
public class LoggerDelegate implements JavaDelegate {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggerDelegate.class);

    @Override
    public void execute(DelegateExecution delegateExecution) {
        log.info("Hello World: {}", delegateExecution);
    }
}
```

Internally, the bean will be resolved using `io.micronaut.inject.qualifiers.Qualifiers.byName(...)`.
Therefore, you can use the annotation `jakarta.inject.Named` to define an explicit bean name and use that name in your expression.

## Configuration

### Data Source

By default, an in-memory H2 data source is preconfigured. Remember to add the runtime dependency `com.h2database:h2` mentioned in [Dependency Management](#dependency-management).

However, you can configure any other database supported by Camunda, e.g. in `application.yml`:

```yaml
datasources:
  default:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres
    username: postgres
    password: secret
    driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver
```

after adding the appropriate driver as a dependency:

```groovy
runtimeOnly("org.postgresql:postgresql:42.2.22")
```

### Connection Pool with HikariCP

This integration uses HikariCP as a database connection pool to optimize performance. By default, the following configuration is applied:
* `datasources.default.minimum-idle: 10`
* `datasources.default.maximum-pool-size: 50`

### Properties

You may use the following properties (typically in application.yml) to configure the Camunda integration.

| Prefix                |Property          | Default                                      | Description            |
|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| camunda               | .locations       | classpath:.                                  | List of locations to scan for model files (default is the resources's root only) |
| camunda.admin-user    | .id              |                                              | If present, a Camunda admin account will be created by this id (including admin group and authorizations) |

|                       | .context-path    | /camunda                                     | Context path for the Webapps |
|                       | .index-redirect-enabled | true                                  | Registers a redirect from / to the Webapps |
| camunda.filter        | .create          |                                              | Name of a "show all" filter for the task list |
| camunda               | .license-file    |                                              | Provide a URL to a license file; if no URL is present it will check your classpath for a file called "camunda-license.txt" |

### Generic Properties

The process engine can be configured using generic properties listed in Camunda's Documentation: [Configuration Properties](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/deployment-descriptors/tags/process-engine/#configuration-properties).

The properties can be set in kebab case (lowercase and hyphen separated) or camel case (indicating the separation of words with a single capitalized letter as written in Camunda's documentation). Kebab case is preferred when setting properties.

Some of the most relevant properties are:
* database-schema-update (databaseSchemaUpdate)
* history
* initialize-telemetry (initializeTelemetry)
* telemetry-reporter-activate (telemetryReporterActivate)

Example:

```yaml
camunda:
  generic-properties:
    properties:
      history: audit
```

### Telemetry

Please consider activating Camunda's telemetry feature so that the Micronaut Camunda Integration appears in Camunda's statistics.

When starting on a fresh database use:

```yaml
camunda:
  generic-properties:
    properties:
      initialize-telemetry: true
```

If you missed the activation on an already active database or want to check/change the setting, go to the admin application and navigate to `System -> Telemetry Feature`. Locally, jump directly to the [Telemetry Feature](http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/admin/default/#/system?section=analytics-settings-general).

# 🏆Advanced Topics

## Camunda REST API and Webapps

Currently, the Camunda REST API and Webapps (Cockpit, Task list, and Admin) are only supported on the server runtime Jetty.

To use them in your project, you have to set the micronaut runtime of your project to `jetty`, e.g.

<details>
<summary>Click to show Gradle configuration</summary>

micronaut-gradle-plugin configuration in build.gradle:

```groovy
micronaut {
    runtime("jetty")
    [...]
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to show Maven configuration</summary>

micronaut-maven-plugin configuration in pom.xml:

```xml
<properties>
  [...]
  <micronaut.runtime>jetty</micronaut.runtime>
</properties>
```

You have to remove this dependency in the pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.micronaut</groupId>
  <artifactId>micronaut-http-server-netty</artifactId>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```
and replace it with
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.micronaut.servlet</groupId>
  <artifactId>micronaut-http-server-jetty</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
</details>

### Configuration of REST API and Webapps
By default, REST API and the Webapps are not enabled. You have to configure them e.g. in the application.yaml as follows:

```yaml
camunda:
  webapps:
    enabled: true
  rest:
    enabled: true
```

Further Information:
* The Webapps are by default available at `/camunda`. By default, `/` will redirect you there.
* The REST API is by default available at `/engine-rest`, e.g. to get the engine name use `GET /engine-rest/engine`.
* See [Configuration Properties](#properties) on how to enable basic authentication for REST, create a default user, or disable the redirect.
* Enabling the REST API or the Webapps impacts the startup time. Depending on your hardware it increases by around 500-1000 milliseconds.

### Advanced Webapps Configuration
The security of the Webapps can be configured with the following properties:

## Camunda Enterprise Edition (EE)
### Add Maven Coordinates

To use the Camunda Enterprise Edition you have to add the Camunda Enterprise repository:

<details>
<summary>Click to show Gradle configuration</summary>

In `build.gradle`:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://app.camunda.com/nexus/content/repositories/camunda-bpm-ee"
        credentials(PasswordCredentials) {
            username "YOUR_USERNAME"
            password "YOUR_PASSWORD"
        }
    }
}
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>Click to show Maven configuration</summary>

In `pom.xml`:
```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>camunda-bpm-nexus-ee</id>
    <name>camunda-bpm-nexus</name>
    <url>
      https://app.camunda.com/nexus/content/repositories/camunda-bpm-ee
    </url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

Furthermore, you have to add your credentials in `~/.m2/settings.xml`:
```xml
<servers>
  <server>
    <id>camunda-bpm-nexus-ee</id>
    <username>YOUR_USERNAME</username>
    <password>YOUR_PASSWORD</password>
  </server>
</servers>
```
</details>

### Replace CE with EE Dependencies
Then remove the CE dependencies and replace them with the EE ones. Here are some example snippets 
on how to do that. Keep in mind using the correct version of the libraries.
<details>
<summary>Click to show Gradle configuration</summary>

In `build.gradle`:
```groovy
implementation("info.novatec:micronaut-camunda-bpm-feature:2.1.0") {
    exclude group: 'org.camunda.bpm.webapp', module: 'camunda-webapp-webjar'
    exclude group: 'org.camunda.bpm', module: 'camunda-engine'
}

implementation("org.camunda.bpm.webapp:camunda-webapp-webjar-ee:7.16.0-ee")
implementation("org.camunda.bpm:camunda-engine:7.16.0-ee")
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>Click to show Maven configuration</summary>

In `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.novatec</groupId>
  <artifactId>micronaut-camunda-bpm-feature</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.0</version>
  <exclusions>
    <exclusion>
      <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.webapp</groupId>
      <artifactId>camunda-webapp-webjar</artifactId>
    </exclusion>
    <exclusion>
      <groupId>org.camunda.bpm</groupId>
      <artifactId>camunda-engine</artifactId>
    </exclusion>
  </exclusions>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.webapp</groupId>
  <artifactId>camunda-webapp-webjar-ee</artifactId>
  <version>7.16.0-ee</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm</groupId>
  <artifactId>camunda-engine</artifactId>
  <version>7.16.0-ee</version>
</dependency>
```
</details>

### Configure your EE license

Camunda will use the license configured in the Cockpit. 

If no license is registered, then the following locations will be checked during startup to register the license:

1. The URL referenced by the property `camunda.license-file`
2. The file `camunda-license.txt` in the resource's root if the property `camunda.license-file` has an empty value
3. The path `.camunda/license.txt` in the user's home directory

If you want to update your license key, use the Camunda Cockpit.

## Process Engine Plugins
Every bean that implements the interface `org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.cfg.ProcessEnginePlugin` is automatically added to the process engine's configuration on start.

You can either
* implement a bean factory with `@io.micronaut.context.annotation.Factory` and add one or more methods returning `ProcessEnginePlugin` instances and annotate each with a bean scope annotation
* annotate your class with `@jakarta.inject.Singleton` and implement the `ProcessEnginePlugin` interface

Example with the LDAP plugin:

```groovy
implementation("org.camunda.bpm.identity:camunda-identity-ldap:7.16.0")
```

```java
import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Factory;
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.cfg.ProcessEnginePlugin;
import org.camunda.bpm.identity.impl.ldap.plugin.LdapIdentityProviderPlugin;
import jakarta.inject.Singleton;

@Factory
public class PluginConfiguration {

    @Singleton
    public ProcessEnginePlugin ldap() {
        // Using a public online LDAP:
        // https://www.forumsys.com/tutorials/integration-how-to/ldap/online-ldap-test-server/
        // Log in e.g. with 'einstein' / 'password'
        LdapIdentityProviderPlugin ldap = new LdapIdentityProviderPlugin();
        ldap.setServerUrl("ldap://ldap.forumsys.com:389");
        ldap.setManagerDn("cn=read-only-admin,dc=example,dc=com");
        ldap.setManagerPassword("password");
        ldap.setBaseDn("dc=example,dc=com");
        return ldap;
    }
}
```

## Custom Process Engine Configuration
With the following bean it's possible to customize the process engine configuration:

```java
import info.novatec.micronaut.camunda.bpm.feature.MnProcessEngineConfiguration;
import info.novatec.micronaut.camunda.bpm.feature.ProcessEngineConfigurationCustomizer;
import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Replaces;
import jakarta.inject.Singleton;

@Singleton
@Replaces(ProcessEngineConfigurationCustomizer.class)
public class MyProcessEngineConfigurationCustomizer implements ProcessEngineConfigurationCustomizer {
    @Override
    public void customize(MnProcessEngineConfiguration processEngineConfiguration) {
        processEngineConfiguration.setProcessEngineName("CustomizedEngine");
    }
}
```

## Custom Job Executor Configuration
With the following bean it's possible to customize the job executor:

```java
import info.novatec.micronaut.camunda.bpm.feature.JobExecutorCustomizer;
import info.novatec.micronaut.camunda.bpm.feature.MnJobExecutor;
import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Replaces;
import jakarta.inject.Singleton;

@Singleton
@Replaces(JobExecutorCustomizer.class)
public class MyJobExecutorCustomizer implements JobExecutorCustomizer {
    @Override
    public void customize(MnJobExecutor jobExecutor) {
        jobExecutor.setWaitTimeInMillis(300);
    }
}
```

## Transaction management

By default the process engine integrates with Micronaut's transaction manager and uses a Hikari connection pool:
* When interacting with the process engine, e.g. starting or continuing a process, the existing transaction will be propagated.
* JavaDelegates and Listeners will have the surrounding Camunda transaction propagated to them allowing the atomic persistence of data.

Optionally, `micronaut-data-jdbc` or `micronaut-data-jpa` are supported.

### Using micronaut-data-jdbc

To enable embedded transactions management support **with micronaut-data-jdbc** please add the following dependencies to your project:

<details>
<summary>Click to show Gradle dependencies</summary>

```groovy
annotationProcessor("io.micronaut.data:micronaut-data-processor")
implementation("io.micronaut.data:micronaut-data-jdbc")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to show Maven dependencies</summary>

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.micronaut.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>micronaut-data-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

And also add the annotation processor to every (!) `annotationProcessorPaths` element:

```xml
<path>
  <groupId>io.micronaut.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>micronaut-data-processor</artifactId>
  <version>${micronaut.data.version}</version>
</path>
```
</details>

and then configure the JDBC properties as described [micronaut-sql documentation](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-sql/latest/guide/#jdbc).

### Using micronaut-data-jpa

To enable embedded transactions management support **with micronaut-data-jpa** please add the following dependencies to your project:

<details>
<summary>Click to show Gradle dependencies</summary>

```groovy
annotationProcessor("io.micronaut.data:micronaut-data-processor")
implementation("io.micronaut.data:micronaut-hibernate-jpa")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to show Maven dependencies</summary>

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.micronaut.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>micronaut-data-hibernate-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

And also add the annotation processor to every (!) `annotationProcessorPaths` element:

```xml
<path>
  <groupId>io.micronaut.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>micronaut-data-processor</artifactId>
  <version>${micronaut.data.version}</version>
</path>
```
</details>

and then configure JPA as described in [micronaut-sql documentation](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-sql/latest/guide/#hibernate).


## Eventing Bridge

The Eventing Bridge maps Camunda Events to Micronaut [ApplicationEvents](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/context/event/ApplicationEvent.html). It's possible to configure three different
event streams:
* Task: All events depending on UserTasks (UserTasks are Created, Assigned, Completed)
* Execution: All execution events (Activities are Started, Ended and Transitions are being taken)
* History: All history events

### Configuration of Eventing Bridge
```yaml
camunda:
  eventing:
    task: true
    execution: true
    history: true
```

### Event Listener Implementation
To consume Micronaut ApplicationEvents you can implement the interface ApplicationEventListener or use the
@EventListener annotation.

<details>
<summary>Click to show example with ApplicationEventListener interface</summary>

```java
public class SampleEventListener implements ApplicationEventListener<TaskEvent> {
  private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SampleEventListener.class);

  @Override
  public void onApplicationEvent(TaskEvent event) {
    log.info("new TaskEvent: EventName={}, Assignee={}", event.getEventName(), event.getAssignee());
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to show example with @EventListener</summary>

```java
@Singleton
public class SampleEventListener { 
  private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SampleEventListener.class);

  @EventListener
  public void onExecutionEvent(ExecutionEvent event) {
    log.info("new ExecutionEvent: {}", event.getEventName());
  }

  @EventListener
  public void onTaskEvent(TaskEvent event) {
    log.info("new TaskEvent: {}", event.getEventName());
  }

  @EventListener
  public void onTaskEvent(HistoryEvent event) {
    log.info("new HistoryEvent: {}", event.getEventType());
  }
}
```
</details>

## Process Tests

Process tests can easily be implemented with JUnit 5 by adding the `camunda-bpm-assert` library as a dependency:

<details>
<summary>Click to show Gradle dependencies</summary>

```groovy
testImplementation("org.camunda.bpm.assert:camunda-bpm-assert:13.0.0")
testImplementation("org.assertj:assertj-core")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to show Maven dependencies</summary>

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.assert</groupId>
  <artifactId>camunda-bpm-assert</artifactId>
  <version>13.0.0</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
  <artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>
  <version>3.20.2</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
</details>

and then implement the test using the usual `@MicronautTest` annotation:

```java
import io.micronaut.test.extensions.junit5.annotation.MicronautTest;
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.ProcessEngine;
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.RuntimeService;
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.runtime.ProcessInstance;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;

import static org.camunda.bpm.engine.test.assertions.bpmn.BpmnAwareTests.*;

@MicronautTest
class HelloWorldProcessTest {

    @Inject
    ProcessEngine processEngine;

    @Inject
    RuntimeService runtimeService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        init(processEngine);
    }

    @Test
    void happyPath() {
        ProcessInstance processInstance = runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("HelloWorld");
        assertThat(processInstance).isStarted();

        assertThat(processInstance).isWaitingAt("TimerEvent_Wait");
        execute(job());

        assertThat(processInstance).isEnded();
    }
}
```

Note: the integration automatically disables the job executor and the process engine's telemetry feature during test execution. This is deduced from the "test" profile.

See also a test in our example application: [HelloWorldProcessTest](/micronaut-camunda-bpm-example/src/test/java/info/novatec/micronaut/camunda/bpm/example/HelloWorldProcessTest.java)

## Docker

When using Gradle we recommend the [Micronaut Application Plugin](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin/blob/master/README.md#micronaut-application-plugin)'s `dockerBuild` task to create a layered Docker image.

<details>
<summary>Workaround for Jetty on Micronaut 2.4.x</summary>

In Micronaut 2.4.x Jetty by default only listened on the "localhost" interface - this has been fixed in Micronaut 2.5.x. For Micronaut 2.4.x you needed to configure Jetty to listen on all interfaces by adding the following to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dockerfile {
    args.set(['-Dmicronaut.server.host=0.0.0.0'])
}
```
</details>

Build the Docker image:

`./gradlew dockerBuild`

Run the Docker image:

`docker run -p 8080:8080 <IMAGE>`

## Updating Camunda

Generally, follow Camunda's instructions regarding [Update to the next Minor Version](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/update/minor/).

If you want to automate the database schema migration you can use [Liquibase](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-liquibase/latest/guide/) or [Flyway](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-flyway/latest/guide/) together with the [migration sql scripts](https://app.camunda.com/nexus/service/rest/repository/browse/public/org/camunda/bpm/distro/camunda-sql-scripts) provided by Camunda.

The following examples are based on Liquibase.

When starting on an empty database, e.g. when using H2 for tests:
```xml
<changeSet author="Tobias" id="1a" >
  <comment>Create common baseline Camunda 7.14 for H2 based on https://app.camunda.com/nexus/service/rest/repository/browse/public/org/camunda/bpm/distro/camunda-sql-scripts/7.14.0/camunda-sql-scripts-7.14.0.zip in directory create</comment>
  <sqlFile path="camunda/h2_engine_7.14.0.sql" relativeToChangelogFile="true" dbms="h2" />
  <sqlFile path="camunda/h2_identity_7.14.0.sql" relativeToChangelogFile="true" dbms="h2" />
</changeSet>
```

If you already have a persistent database with the database schema of 7.14 which is not yet managed by Liquibase, e.g. PostgreSQL:
```xml
<changeSet author="Tobias" id="1b" >
  <comment>Create common baseline Camunda 7.14 for PostgreSQL (even if schema already exists) based on https://app.camunda.com/nexus/service/rest/repository/browse/public/org/camunda/bpm/distro/camunda-sql-scripts/7.14.0/camunda-sql-scripts-7.14.0.zip in directory create</comment>
  <preConditions onFail="MARK_RAN">
    <not>
      <tableExists tableName="ACT_RU_JOB" />
    </not>
  </preConditions>
  <sqlFile path="camunda/postgres_engine_7.14.0.sql" relativeToChangelogFile="true" dbms="postgresql" />
  <sqlFile path="camunda/postgres_identity_7.14.0.sql" relativeToChangelogFile="true" dbms="postgresql" />
</changeSet>
```

When updating to a new Camunda version first apply all patch updates (if available) and then update to the next minor version:
```xml
<changeSet author="Tobias" id="2" >
  <comment>Update to Camunda 7.15 based on https://app.camunda.com/nexus/repository/public/org/camunda/bpm/distro/camunda-sql-scripts/7.15.0/camunda-sql-scripts-7.15.0.zip in directory upgrade</comment>
  <!-- no patch files available for 7.14.x ... -->
  <sqlFile path="camunda/h2_engine_7.14_to_7.15.sql" relativeToChangelogFile="true" dbms="h2" />
  <sqlFile path="camunda/postgres_engine_7.14_to_7.15.sql" relativeToChangelogFile="true" dbms="postgresql" />
</changeSet>
```

## Pitfalls

### No version information in Fat/Uber/Shadow JAR

If you create a Fat/Uber/Shadow JAR and run that you will see a warning:

`WARN  i.n.m.c.b.f.MnProcessEngineConfiguration - The Camunda version cannot be determined. If you created a Fat/Uber/Shadow JAR then please consider using the Micronaut Application Plugin's 'dockerBuild' task to create a Docker image.`

This is because the repackaging of the jars implicitly removes the META-INF information.

Missing version information leads to
* Detailed telemetry cannot be sent to Camunda because the version is mandatory 
* EE license cannot be configured

Instead, of creating a Fat/Uber/Shadow JAR, please see instructions on creating a [Docker](#docker) image and use the resulting image to run a Docker container.

### Executing Blocking Operations on Netty's I/O Thread Pool
When using the default server implementation Netty, blocking operations must be performed on I/O instead of Netty threads to avoid possible deadlocks. Therefore, as soon as Camunda ["borrows a client thread"](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/current/user-guide/process-engine/transactions-in-processes/)  you have to make sure that the [event loop is not blocked](https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/june-2020-micronaut-2-dont-let-event-loops-own-you).
A frequently occurring example is the implementation of a REST endpoint which interacts with the process engine. By default, Micronaut would use a Netty thread for this blocking operation. To prevent the use of a Netty thread it is recommended to use the annotation [`@ExecuteOn(TaskExecutors.IO)`](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#reactiveServer). This will make sure that an I/O thread is used.

```java
@Post("/hello-world-process")
@ExecuteOn(TaskExecutors.IO)
public String startHelloWorldProcess() {
    return runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("HelloWorld").getId();
}
```

### Camunda Platform Assertions - Multiple process tests
If you create multiple process tests, you need to add the following initialisation code in each test:

```java
@Inject
ProcessEngine processEngine;

@BeforeEach
void setUp() {
    init(processEngine);
}
```

This makes the assertions aware of your process engine. Otherwise, it tries to reuse the engine of the test that got
executed first and that may already be shut down, see [Camunda Platform Assert User Guide](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-assert/blob/master/docs/README.md#using-a-non-default-process-engine).

Here is a complete example: [HelloWorldProcessTest](/micronaut-camunda-bpm-example/src/test/java/info/novatec/micronaut/camunda/bpm/example/HelloWorldProcessTest.java).
